\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Outline of proposed research project}

The text Counterexamples in Topology by Steen and Seebach has been a fabulous resource for students and
researchers in Topology since its publication in 1970. The book was the product of an undergraduate research
project funded by NSF and supervised by Steen and Seebach (and including then student Gary Gruenhage) to
systematically survey important topological counterexamples. More recently James Dabbs has implemented a
database on Github based on the Steen and Seebach textbook called Pi-Base (see \href{https://topology.pi-base.org/}{https://topology.pi-base.org/})
and it is currently being maintained by Dabbs and Stephen Clontz. This resource has great potential to both
researchers and advanced undergraduate and graduate students at the start of their research careers. There are
still big gaps in the database's subject matter, especially in relation to research in and around Frechet-Urysohn
spaces. There is a significant body of work, and especially interesting counterexamples, concerning Michael's
class of bisequential spaces, Arhangel'skii's alpha-i spaces and several game theoretic formulations of
convergence which do not yet appear in the Pi-Base. The project has two goals. The first, and most accessible,
is to give a systematic survey of the recent research which will be implemented into the Pi-Base database. The
second half of the project will be devoted to open problems related to a recent class of examples defined from
ladder systems (more generally on so called square-sequence) described in two

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Frechet Fan - \(S_{\omega}\): \(\omega \times (\omega + 1) / \omega \times \{\infty\}\) (i.e. \(\omega \times ( \omega + 1)\) with the points at infinity identified). Show that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(S_{\omega}\) is not first countable \checkmark
        \item \(S_{\omega}\) is Fréchet. \checkmark
    \end{itemize}

    \item Product of Fréchet spaces not always Fréchet: take \((\omega + 1) \times S_{\omega}\). Let \(A = \{(m, (m, n)) \: : \: m,n \in \omega\). Show that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \((\omega + 1, \infty) \in \overline{A}\)
        \item No sequence in \(A\) converges to \((\omega + 1, \infty)\).
    \end{itemize}

    \item Right way to think about sequences: \(A \subseteq X\) converges to \(a \in X\) if \(|A| = \aleph_0\) and for all neighboourhoods \(U_x \subseteq X\), \(|A \setminus U_x| < \aleph_0\).
    
    \item Right way to think about Fréchet space: take sequential closure once same as closure.

\subsection{Basics}

\subsection{Sequential and Fréchet Spaces}

\begin{defn}\cite{AH90}
    For a topological space \(X\) and any set \(A \subset X\), the \textit{sequential closure} of \(A\) is  
    \[
        \seqcl{A} := \left\{x \in X \: : \: \exists (x_n) \in A \left(\lim_{n\to \infty} x_n = x\right) \right\}.
    \]
    The \textit{total sequential closure} of \(A\) is the operation of recursively taking the sequential closure of \(A\) until 
    \[
        \seqcl{\seqcl{\seqcl{A}}\dots} = \overline{A}.
    \]
\end{defn}

\begin{fact}
    In general it takes at most \(\omega_1\) many iterations of the sequential closure to get a closed set. 
\end{fact}

\begin{defn}
    \leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item\cite{EK89} A space \(X\) is \textit{sequential} if 
        \[
        \displaystyle A \subset X \text{ is closed } \iff \forall (x_n) \in A\left(\lim_{n\to \infty} x_n \in A\right).
        \] 
        \item A space \(X\) is said to sequential if sequentially closed sets are closed.
    \end{enumerate}
    
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    A space \(X\) is said to be Fréchet if \(\seqcl{A} = \overline{A}\) for all \(A \subseteq X\).
\end{defn}
\begin{exam}
    Let \(X = \omega_1 + 1\) with the order topology. \(X\) is not Fréchet, since any sequence \((x_n) \in \omega_1\) cannot converge to \(\infty\), as otherwise \(\omega_1 = \sup\{x_n \: : \: n \in \bN\}\), a contradiction.
\end{exam}
Clearly then, if a space is Fréchet then it is also Sequential. The following example shows that the converse is not true. 
\begin{exam}
    Let \(X^{\ast} = \omega \times (\omega + 1)\) be given the order topology and let \(X =  X^{\ast} \cup \{\infty\}\) where the neighboourhoods  of \(\infty\) are such that there exists \(p \in \omega\) such that \(|\{(m, n) \: : \: m > p, n \in \omega + 1\} \setminus U_{\infty}| < \aleph_0\). Then \(X\) is sequential but but not Fréchet. To see this, note that for all \(m \in \omega\) the sequence \(A_m = \{(m, n) \: : \: n \in \omega\}\) converges to \((m, \omega + 1)\) and moreover \(B = \{(m, \omega + 1) \: : \: m \in \omega\}\) is a sequence that converges to \(\infty\). Then \(A = \bigcup_{m \in \omega} A_m\) is such that \(\seqcl{\seqcl{A}} = X\), hence \(X\) is sequential. On the other hand there is no sequence in \(A\) that converges to \(\infty\). Suppose there were, say some \(\gamma \to \infty\). Then for all \(m \in \omega\), \(U_m = X \setminus \{(m, n)\: : \: n \in \omega + 1\}\) is a neighboourhood of \(\infty\) such that \(|\gamma \setminus U_m| < \aleph_0\). Hence \(\gamma\) has only finitely many terms belonging to each column. If \(\alpha_m = \max\{\gamma \cap \{(m, n) \: : \: n \in \omega\}\}\), then \(U = X \setminus \bigcup_{m \in \omega} \{(m ,n )\: : \:  n \leq \alpha_m\}\) is a neighbourhood of \(\infty\) disjoint from \(\gamma\), a contradiction. Hence \(X\) is not Fréchet. 
\end{exam} 
\begin{prop}
    If \(X\) is first countable then \(X\) is Fréchet.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(A \subseteq X\) and let \(x \in \overline{A}\). Then \(x\) has a countable neighbourhood base \(N_x\) such that \(U \cap A \neq \nothing\) for all \(U \in N_x\). Enumerating the neighboourhoods of \(x\) as \(U_1, U_2, \dots\) then the sequence \((x_n)_{n \ge 1}\) where \(x_n \in U_n \cap A\) for each \(n \in \omega\) is such that \((x_n)_{n \ge 1}\) converges to \(x\).
\end{proof}
The following example shows that the converse is not true. 
\begin{exam}[Fréchet Fan]
    Let \(S_{\omega}\) be the quotient of \(\omega \times (\omega + 1)\) obtained by identifying all the points \(\{(m, \omega + 1) \: : \: m \in \omega\}\). More precisely \(S_{\omega}\) has the quotient topology induced by the map \(h: \omega \times (\omega + 1) \to S_{\omega}\) where \(h(x) = x\) for all \(x \in \omega \times \omega\) and \(h(x) = \infty\) for all \(x \in \omega \times \{\omega + 1\}\). Then \(S_{\omega}\) is Fréchet but not 1st countable. To see that \(S_{\omega}\) is Fréchet, note that by definition of the quotient topology, the open neighbourhoods of \(\infty\) are those sets \(U \subset S_{\omega}\) such that \(\infty \in U\) and \(h^{-1}(U)\) is open in \(\omega \times (\omega + 1)\). As \(\{(m, \omega + 1) \: : \:  m \in \omega\} \subset h^{-1}(U)\) we see that \(U\) is an open neighbourhood of \(\infty\) iff \(h^{-1}(U)\) is an open neighbourhood of \((m, \omega + 1)\) for all \(m \in \omega\).  Note that  \(h^{-1}(m \times (f(m), \infty]) = m \times (f(m), \omega + 1)\) is an open neighboourhood of \((m, \omega + 1)\) for each \(m \in \omega\) where \(f: \omega \to \omega\) is just some mapping that indicates the startpoint of each interval. Hence the open neighboourhoods of \(\infty\) are of the form \(\bigcup_{m \in \omega}m \times (f(m), \infty]\). It follows that for all \(m \in \omega\) the sequence \(A_m = \{(m, n) \: : \: n \in \omega\}\) converges to \(\infty\) so that \(A = \bigcup_{m \in \omega}A_m\) is such that \(\seqcl{A} = S_{\omega}\). On the other hand it's obvious that \(\overline{A} = S_{\omega}\), so that \(S_{\omega}\) is indeed Fréchet. Now asssuming that \(S_{\omega}\) was countable, we would have a countable neighbourhood base at \(\infty\). For each \(k \in \omega\) let \(B_k = \bigcup_{m \in \omega}m \times (f_k(m), \infty]\) for some \(f_k: \omega \to \omega\) determining the startpoints of each interval. Suppose \(\B = \{B_k \: : \: k \in \omega\}\) is a base at \(\infty\), then let \(f^{\ast}: \omega \to \omega\) be defined by \(f^{\ast}(m) = f_m(m) + 1\) for all \(m \in \omega\). Letting \(B^{\ast} = \bigcup_{m \in \omega}m \times (f^{\ast}(m), \infty]\) it is clear by construction that \(B_k \not\subset B^{\ast}\) for all \(k \in \omega\). Thus \(\B\) cannot be a neighboourhood base, i.e., \(S_{\omega}\) is not first countable.
    
\end{exam}
\begin{defn}\cite{NY92}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space and \(\xi\) be a countable family of sequences converging to a point \(x_0 \in X\). We say that \(x_0\) is an \(\alpha_i\) point for \(i = 1, 2, 3, 4\) if there exists a sequence \(\beta\) such that 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\alpha_1\):  \(|\gamma \setminus \beta| < \aleph_0\) for every \(\gamma \in \xi\);
        \item \(\alpha_2\): \(|\gamma \cap \beta| = \aleph_0\) for every \(\gamma \in \xi\);
        \item \(\alpha_3\): \(|\gamma \cap \beta| = \aleph_0\) for infinitely many \(\gamma \in \xi\);
        \item \(\alpha_4\): \(\gamma \cap \beta \neq \nothing\) for infinitely many \(\gamma \in \xi\).
    \end{itemize}
    Then \(X\) is an \(\alpha_i\) space if every \(x \in X\) is an \(\alpha_i\) point.
\end{defn}





\subsection{Bisequential Spaces}

\begin{defn}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space. If for all \(x \in X\) and \(\mathcal{F} \subset \P(X)\) an ultrafilter which clusters at \(x\) there exists a sequence of sets \(A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq A_3 \dots\) where each \(A_i \in \F\)
\end{defn}





\subsection{Topological Games}
\subsubsection{Two Player Convergence Game \texorpdfstring{\cite{GH76}})}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space and designate a point \(x_0 \in X\). The two player game is defined as follows: 
    \begin{itemize}
            \item On turn one player I chooses an open set \(U_1\) containing \(x_0\) and player II then chooses a point \(x_1 \in U_1\);
            \item On the \(n\)'th turn player I chooses an open set \(U_n\) containing \(x_0\) and player II then chooses a point \(x_n \in U_n\).
    \end{itemize}  
    Player I wins the game if the sequence \(x_n\) converges to \(x_0\).
