abstract = {In this paper we introduce a new class of spaces, called W-spaces, which is defined in terms of a simple two-person infinite game. Every first-countable space is a W-space, and every W-space is countably bi-sequential. The W-space property is preserved by subspaces, Σ-products, and open mappings. Separable W-spaces are first-countable. Various other properties of W-spaces are studied, and some questions are posed.}
